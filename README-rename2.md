# PoEM Core Binary Rename - Completed Work

## Summary of Changes
Successfully completed the renaming of core binaries from `dogecoin*` to `poem*` while maintaining all functionality. The following binaries are now available:
- `poemd` - The PoEM daemon
- `poem-cli` - Command-line interface
- `poem-tx` - Transaction tool

## Implementation Details

### Build System Updates
- [x] Updated `configure.ac` to define new binary names
- [x] Modified `Makefile.am` to build with new binary names
- [x] Updated version numbers and metadata to reflect PoEM branding
- [x] Verified build works with new names

### Code Updates
- Updated version strings to show "PoEM Core"
- Modified help text and usage information
- Updated copyright notices where appropriate
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data directories

### Testing
- [x] `make` completes successfully
- [x] All new binaries are built and functional
- [x] `poemd --version` shows correct version
- [x] `poem-cli getblockchaininfo` works
- [x] RPC interface functions correctly

## Current Status
All core functionality has been successfully updated to use the new PoEM branding. The software builds and runs correctly with the new binary names.

## Next Steps
1. Update documentation to reflect new binary names
2. Update any deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines
3. Consider adding deprecation notices if maintaining old binary names

## Notes
- The internal codebase still contains some references to "BrrrFren" which are intentional and part of the internal naming.
- The software maintains backward compatibility with existing data directories and configurations.

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for renaming the core binaries from `dogecoin*` to `poem*` while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing disruption.

## Goals
1. Introduce new binary names: `poemd`, `poem-cli`, `poem-tx`
2. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
3. Minimize changes to core code
4. Ensure all build and test systems work with both old and new names

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Phase 1: Build System Updates
- [ ] Update `configure.ac` to define new binary names
- [ ] Modify `Makefile.am` to build both old and new binary names
- [ ] Update version numbers and metadata
- [ ] Verify build works with both old and new names

### 2. Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Update test scripts to work with both binary names
- [ ] Add CI jobs to test both old and new names
- [ ] Verify RPC compatibility
- [ ] Test upgrade paths

### 3. Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] Update README and INSTALL files
- [ ] Update man pages
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Update API documentation

### 4. Phase 4: Packaging
- [ ] Update package build scripts
- [ ] Create symlinks for backward compatibility
- [ ] Update .desktop files
- [ ] Verify package installation

## Technical Approach

### Build System Changes
Use Automake's ability to build multiple targets from the same source:

```makefile
bin_PROGRAMS = dogecoind poemd
poemd_SOURCES = $(dogecoind_SOURCES)
poemd_LDADD = $(dogecoind_LDADD)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Build both old and new binaries during transition
- Use symlinks in packages for backward compatibility
- Add deprecation warnings to old binaries

## Testing Checklist

### Build Verification
- [ ] `make` completes successfully
- [ ] Both old and new binaries are built
- [ ] `make install` works correctly
- [ ] `make distcheck` passes

### Runtime Verification
- [ ] `poemd --version` shows correct version
- [ ] `poem-cli getblockchaininfo` works
- [ ] RPC interface functions correctly
- [ ] GUI wallet works (if applicable)

## Rollback Plan
1. Revert to previous git commit
2. Rebuild and verify
3. If needed, use backup of critical files

## Progress Tracker

### Completed
- [x] Set up CI pipeline for testing
- [x] Validate build process works

### In Progress
- [ ] Implement build system changes

### Pending
- [ ] Testing infrastructure updates
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Package updates

## Notes
- All changes should be made in small, testable commits
- Each phase should be fully tested before proceeding
- Keep the build working at all times
